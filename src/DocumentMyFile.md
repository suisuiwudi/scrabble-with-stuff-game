I write both JUnit Test and a main test in GameSystem.java.

Thogh I still write some test in the test folder.

I make several changes base on the feedback:
1.I change the name of several class to minize the gap between real word and design,like LetterTileBags.
3.I implement the scoring process,please see the main method(as a test) in the GameSystem.java.
4.I delay the action of checking is in dictionary untill someone challenges.
5.I let the move to check whether the placement is in line.
6.I add a Word class to help calculating the score.
7.The system gathers information about the activation of special tiles like setting flag/collecting infomation.
8.I make some changes as specified in Javadoc.
